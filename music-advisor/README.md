# Music Advisor

## Learning outcomes
Brace yourself, as there is so much to learn: work with Spotify’s API, get acquainted with Java Generics and apply design patterns to make your code from good to superb.

## About
Modern world spoils us with a wide variety of music: pop-lovers, rockers, rappers and club enthusiasts alike face a nearly infinite choice. Fortunately, there are programs that can help us find something we like and not get lost in this variety: in this project, you will write a program like this. Create a personal music advisor that makes preference-based suggestions and even shares links to new releases and featured playlists. Together with Spotify, your music advisor will be a powerful guide to the world of music.

## What you'll do and what you'll learn:
### Stage 1
Get started: enable the program to search for relevant songs among manually entered items.
### Stage 2
Figure out how to work with the constructor, Gradle, classes, and of course, OAuth. Now you can connect to Spotify using your login!
### Stage 3
Get familiar with the usage of anonymous classes and make the connection with Spotify reciprocal.
### Stage 4
Working with Java generics and dependencies, upload the links, process them and display them nicely in your program.
### Stage 5
Apply a design pattern to improve your code and make the user’s experience smoother
