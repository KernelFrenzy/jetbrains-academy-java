# Phone Book

## Learning outcomes
You will learn a variety of sorting and search algorithms, one of which is recursive. If it is algorithm competence that you’re after, this project is definitely for you.

## About
You suddenly remember you need to call your aunt and wish her a happy birthday, but how do you find her number quickly in a giant phonebook? Write a program that will solve this problem once and forever: create a phonebook where you can easily, quickly and efficiently find necessary information. Names and numbers, here we come.

## What you'll do and what you'll learn:
### Stage 1
Start with linear search: find data in an unordered database.
### Stage 2
Sort your data before searching using Bubble Sort algorithm, and then apply Jump Search to find a number you’re after.
### Stage 3
Speed up the process with the help of QuickSort and Binary Search.
### Stage 4
Search the data inside the large dataset in zero seconds.
