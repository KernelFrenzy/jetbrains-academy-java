# Coffee Machine

## Learning outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. Challenge yourself with loops and conditions, practice working with classes, and get more confident in Java.

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## What you'll do and what you'll learn:
### Stage 1
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!
### Stage 2
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
### Stage 3
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
### Stage 4
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
### Stage 5
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
### Stage 6
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
