# Cinema Room REST Service

## Learning outcomes
In this project, you will create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.

## About
Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? Having a booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!

## What you'll do and what you'll learn:
### Stage 1
Create a simple endpoint that returns the information about the available seats.
### Stage 2
Allow customers to purchase tickets. Learn how you can handle user mistakes.
### Stage 3
Allow customers to refund their tickets. Generate unique tokens to identify the ticket.
### Stage 4
Add the movie theater statistics and secure the endpoint with a password.
