## About
An urge to cook something special is too hard to resist sometimes. But what if you lost the recipe? Or your beloved grandma is too busy to answer a call and remind you of your favorite cake recipe? Let's make a program that stores all recipes in one place. Create a multi-user web service with Spring Boot that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.

## What you'll do and what you'll learn:
### Stage 1
Implement a simple JSON API that supports adding and retrieving a recipe.
### Stage 2
Improve the web service to support multiple recipes.
### Stage 3
Add a database to store and delete recipes.
### Stage 4
Retrieve recipes by their category/name and update them if you need to.
### Stage 5
Improve the service to support registration and multiple users.
