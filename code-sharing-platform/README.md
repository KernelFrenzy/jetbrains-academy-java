# Code Sharing Platform

## Learning outcomes
You will get acquainted with server development on Spring Boot and touch on some basic topics in Web-programming such as HTML, CSS, and JS.

## About
There is a lot of collaboration in programming: many projects require sharing your code with other developers. Using open web resources such as Pastebin is not always an option. In this project, you will create your own secure version of a code-sharing platform.

## What you'll do and what you'll learn:
### Stage 1
Show the same code snippet over and over in the API and the web interface.
### Stage 2
Use POST requests to update the snippet and make your program display the time of the most recent update.
### Stage 3
Use the template engine FreeMarker to easily implement the latest snippets feed.
### Stage 4
Use a database to store all the code snippets.
### Stage 5
Implement a few access restrictions for the top-secret code snippets.
